# Bake Result

``boilerplate.bake()`` returns a result instance with a bunch of fields that
hold useful information:

* ``exit_code``: is the exit code of devxhub_python, ``0`` means successful termination
* ``exception``: is the exception that happened if one did
* ``project_path``: a [Path] object pointing to the rendered project
* ``context``: is the rendered context

The [Path] instance in `project_path` provides you with a powerful interface to
filesystem related information, that comes in handy for validating the generated
project layout and even file contents:

```python
def test_readme(boilerplate):
    result = boilerplate.bake()

    readme_file = result.project_path / "README.rst"
    readme_lines = readme_file.read_text().splitlines()

    assert readme_lines == ["helloworld", "=========="]
```
